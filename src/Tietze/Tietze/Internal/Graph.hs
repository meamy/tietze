-- * Graph Types

-- | Represents the set of edges originating a vertex v. Each element u represents a
-- directed edge (u, v).
type EdgeSet a = Set.Set a

-- | Represents a graph as a mapping from vertex names to edge sets.
newtype Digraph a = Digraph (Map.Map a (EdgeSet a)) deriving (Show, Eq)

-- | Represents a walk as a bidirectional sequence of vertices.
type GraphWalk a = Seq.Seq a

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- * Graph Construction.

-- | Creates an empty edge set.
empty :: EdgeSet a
empty = Set.empty

-- | Creates an edge set from a list.
fromList :: (Ord a) => [a] -> EdgeSet a
fromList = Set.fromList

-- | Converts a list to a path.
listToWalk :: [a] -> GraphWalk a
listToWalk = Seq.fromList

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- * Graph Inspection.

-- | Consumes a graph and a vertex. Returns the set of edges originating from the vertex.
edgeSet :: (Ord a) => Digraph a -> a -> EdgeSet a
edgeSet (Digraph g) v = fromMaybe empty (Map.lookup v g)

-- | Consumes a graph and a vertex. Returns the list of all adjacent vertices.
adjacencyList :: (Ord a) => Digraph a -> a -> [a]
adjacencyList g v = Set.toList (edgeSet g v)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- * Cycle Detection (Depth-First Search).

-- | Consumes a walk (w) and a vertex (v). If w starts and ends at the same vertex, then
-- w is returned. Otherwise, v is returned.

    | otherwise = v <| seq
    where seq = (l :<| rest) :|> r

-- | Consumes a graph (g), a vertex in the graph (v), and a set of previously visited
-- vertices (seen). That is, there exists a walk w to v that visits all vertices in seen.
-- If there exists a walk w' from v such that w' appended to w is a lasso (path++cycle),
-- the cycle is returned as a sequence of vertices. Otherwise, nothing is returned.
--
-- Note: If c is not unique, then this function returns the first such c discovered by a
-- depth-first search.

-- Note: Mutually depends on findCycleFromVertices

-- | Consumes a graph (g), a frontier of vertices in the graph (list), and a set of
